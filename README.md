# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of **beginner-friendly Machine Learning projects** designed to understand core ML concepts such as **data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation**.

Each project focuses on a different **type of ML algorithms**.

## Overview

This repository contains multiple **mini ML projects** built using **Python** and popular libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **numpy**.

These projects are ideal for:
- Students learning ML basics  
- Building a strong **GitHub portfolio for placements**  
- Practicing ML concepts and interview preparation
